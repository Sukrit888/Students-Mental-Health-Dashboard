## Students-Mental-Health-Dashboard ðŸ§ 
This project is an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit that visualizes key insights from a student mental health survey dataset. The application allows users to filter data and explore the relationships between various factorsâ€”such as academic year, sleep quality, and stress relief activitiesâ€”and student mental health metrics.

This dashboard serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate skills in data analysis, data visualization, and building interactive web applications with Python.

## Key Features
Interactive Filters: Use the sidebar to filter the data by age range and gender.

Key Metrics: View average scores for depression, anxiety, and stress.

Data Visualizations: Explore insights through dynamic charts, including:

A bar chart showing mental health scores by academic year.

A bar chart comparing scores based on sleep quality.

A horizontal bar chart of the most common stress relief activities.

## Project Straucture
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                     # The main Streamlit application script.
â”œâ”€â”€ MentalHealthSurvey.csv     # The dataset used for the dashboard.
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt           # List of required Python libraries.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is from the MentalHealthSurvey.csv file, which contains anonymized responses on various mental health indicators from a student population.

## Technologies Used
Python

Streamlit: For building the interactive web application.

Pandas: For data cleaning and analysis.

Plotly Express: For creating dynamic and interactive visualizations.

## Deployment
This app is designed for easy deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud. Since the dataset is included in the repository, the app will automatically be able to locate and load the data after you link your GitHub repository.
